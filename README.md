# Portfolio
Hi!!This is my portfolio.
---
I have created this portfolio for my USER INTERFACE DESIGN class project phase 1. I am a beginner and used help of different sources to learn and create this portfolio website.
This project is a personal website built to showcase my background, skills, and projects as I begin my journey into web development. This README explains the structure and content of each page so that anyone visiting or reviewing the code can understand what’s going on behind the scenes.

The website is a single-page layout with navigation bar that redirects to each section using anchor links. All the content is written in basic HTML and CSS. No advanced frameworks have been used, making it simple and beginner-friendly.
Here’s a breakdown of the major sections on the page:
---
# Home
The homepage consistes of brief introduction
My full name displayed prominently.
A navigation bar at the top that allows users to navigate to different sections of the page like About, Skills, Projects, and Contact.
A complete division for social media icons and also a button to download my resume.

# About
The “About” section is where I talk a little bit about myself:
Who I am: a passionate beginner and a first-year student aiming to become a skilled software developer.
My interests in coding, problem-solving, and learning new technologies.
A brief overview of my current learning path and dedication to growing in the tech field.

# Skills
Next is skills section.
This section is dedicated to the technical and soft skills I’m currently building. Here’s how it’s structured:
A list or grid layout showing languages, tools, and technologies I’ve been working with (like Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

# Projects
The next page is projects section
This part of the portfolio highlights some of the beginner-level projects I’ve worked on (and will continue to update). For each project listed, I try to include:
The project name or title.
A short description of what the project does or what it’s about.
A link (if available) to view the project or see the code on GitHub.

# Contact
The final section of the website includes contact information so that people can reach out to me easily. It includes:
A simple contact form which asks the users to enter required details.
It’s a way for collaborators, mentors, or recruiters to get in touch.

Everything is kept in the root directory since the project is still simple. Might edit it in the future
